    "*  World& US section recently covers Actor Jussie Smollet, felony disorderly conduct, racist homophobic attack. Business section recently covers public utilities commisions, PG&E, crude oil price and trading. Lifestyle section recently covered travling(Tahoe lake,Golden Gate Park, Dodge Rideg Ski,leland snowplay) and wine tasting. \n",

    "*  Also we can see that category affects topics. For example, president Donald Trump/ was mentioned in both the world and business page but not(or rarely) mentioned in lifestyle section this might be because the lifestyle page tends to provide reders with smaller scale information(such as entertainment/traveling) rather than larger scale inforation(such as national news/business).
